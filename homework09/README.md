# HW 9

The goal of this HW is simple. Duplicate homework 8 problem 2 using neural networks. Contrast regression versus using i.) a neural network with 2 hidden nodes and ii.) 4 hidden nodes over 2 layers with 2 hidden nodes in each layer. All layers should be full connectected, MSE the loss function, a linear output activation layer and RELUs otherwise.

You should return an ipynb nothebook with your code and a final table contrasting the different error rates of the different approaches you tried.
