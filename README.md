# Data Science Tutorials
This repository contains 11 homework assignments and one final project for a data science course. The assignments are designed to help you build your skills in data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. The final project will give you an opportunity to apply these skills to a real-world dataset and solve a practical problem.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Each homework assignment is contained in a separate Jupyter notebook. You should complete the notebooks in order, as the assignments build upon each other.

For each homework assignment, you should read the instructions and complete the tasks outlined in the notebook. Some assignments will require you to write code to manipulate, visualize, or analyze data, while others will ask you to answer conceptual questions or interpret results.

Once you've completed all 11 homework assignments, you can start working on the final project. The final project will require you to apply the skills you've learned in the course to a new dataset and problem.

## Homework Assignments
The homework assignments are organized as follows:

1. Data Cleaning and Preparation
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Data Visualization
4. Probability and Statistics
5. Linear Regression
6. Logistic Regression
7. k-Nearest Neighbors
8. Decision Trees and Random Forests
9. Support Vector Machines
10. Unsupervised Learning
11. Deep Learning

## Final Project
The final project will require you to apply the skills you've learned in the course to a new dataset and problem. You should choose a dataset that interests you and is relevant to your career or academic interests. The project should demonstrate your ability to manipulate, visualize, and analyze data, as well as your ability to communicate your findings effectively.

## Requirements
This repository requires the following software:

Python 3
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
